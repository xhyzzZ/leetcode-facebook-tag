// leetcode 295 Find Median from Data Stream

/*
time: O(nlogn)
space: O(1)
I keep two heaps (or priority queues):

Max-heap small has the smaller half of the numbers.
Min-heap large has the larger half of the numbers.
The length of smaller half is kept to be n / 2 at all time 
and the length of the larger half is either n / 2 or n / 2 + 1 depend on n's parity.

Any time before we add a new number, there are two scenarios, (total n numbers, k = n / 2):

(1) length of (small, large) == (k, k)
(2) length of (small, large) == (k, k + 1)
After adding the number, total (n + 1) numbers, they will become:

(1) length of (small, large) == (k, k + 1)
(2) length of (small, large) == (k + 1, k + 1)
