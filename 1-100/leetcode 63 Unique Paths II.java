// leetcode 63 Unique Paths II

/*
time: O(m * n)
space: O(n)

This is a typical 2D DP problem, we can store value in 2D DP array, 
but since we only need to use value at dp[i - 1][j] and dp[i][j - 1] 
to update dp[i][j], we don't need to store the whole 2D table, 
but instead store value in an 1D array, and update data by 
using dp[j] = dp[j] + dp[j - 1], (where here dp[j] corresponding to the 
dp[i - 1][j]) and dp[j - 1] corresponding to the dp[i][j - 1] in the 2D array)

dp[j]          = dp[j] + dp[j - 1]
dp[i - 1][j]   =       + dp[i][j - 1]

dp[j] += dp[j - 1];
is
dp[j] = dp[j] + dp[j - 1];
which is new dp[j] = old dp[j] + dp[j-1]
which is current cell = top cell + left cell
